- Our API was designed so that historical data ("Game" entries) are bundled through Summoner-detail endpoint.
    - This is a problem if we save more than last 10 games to DB.
        - We currently DO append "new" games to Summoner game_sets.
        - Riot API currently returns last 10 games only.
            - This will probably change with Riot's new matchhistory API.
    - Consider separating Game entries from Summoner data, so if/when we get large # of games stored
     for any single summoner, we can paginate or load them dynamically (e.g. as user scrolls down page).

- Determine when to update data from Riot API
    - When our API is called, check `last_update` and do so automatically before returning data?
    - As above, but when page is visited, via AJAX call to a view that updates such?
    - Only manually, via "Refresh Data" button on page?

- Investigate following problem:
    - First seen on our API page load.
    - Related to hyper-aggressive Chrome pre-fetching?

- Problem w/weird summoner names (ex. "IS141dca1d0484dcf8adc09")
    - These were originally seen from EUW queries to nightdark's match history
    - Other sites get accurate data though :(
    - When trying to look up summoner info on these names, no summoner found

- Remove default region args and ensure all calls specify region!
